# Prints a short story about Bobby conquering his fear of water hazards on golf courses 
print('On a hot summer day in Tucson, Az, Bobby encounters his biggest challenge of the day and it is not even 9 am yet.')
print('This challenge was the water hazard on the 18th hole at Crooked Tree Golf Course.') 
print('With a deep breath, he remembered all of his training and tried hard to focus on technique like his coach taught him.') 
print('He sent the ball flying through the sky as he looked on and saw it clear the water and land inches from the pin.')
print('As he taps in the putt he leaves the course that day having conquered not only the course but his own doubt.')
